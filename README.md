# AICord Applet Examples & Manifests
This repository contains real, running examples of AICord Applets. Each in a separate folder.

## How to use
Each folder contains 2 files:
* `applet.js` - main applet code
* `manifest.json` - manifest thats added on AICord Dashboard for that applet

Don't forget to replace secrets with real secrets! Public applet manifests with secrets are safe to publish on dashboard as new users will have to input their own ones and cannot see your secrets!
